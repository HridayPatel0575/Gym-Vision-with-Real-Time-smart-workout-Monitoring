# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Vision - Real-Time Smart Workout Monitoring

This project is designed to build an intelligent gym assistant using computer vision techniques. It tracks workout activities, detects exercise forms in real-time, and provides feedback on posture, counts, and performance, aiming to enhance solo gym sessions without requiring human supervision.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Gym Vision** leverages real-time video processing with technologies like **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **YOLO** to:
- Monitor workout movements via webcam or video input
- Detect posture using keypoints
- Count repetitions and track time duration
- Alert user on incorrect form or incomplete range of motion

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- 🔍 **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, YOLOv8
- 🐍 **Programming Language**: Python
- 📊 **Visualization**: Matplotlib / Tkinter Dashboard (optional)
- 💾 **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- 📦 **Model Integration**: Pre-trained pose estimation models

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a real-time monitoring system for common gym workouts (e.g., squats, push-ups, curls)
- Provide visual feedback on user posture using pose estimation
- Track and display workout statistics: reps, sets, form alerts, etc.
- Lay the foundation for integrating this system into smart mirrors or mobile apps

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Real-time video feed processing
- ✅ Human pose detection and landmark tracking
- ✅ Smart rep counter with customizable thresholds
- ✅ Posture accuracy feedback
- ✅ Modular design for adding new exercises easily
